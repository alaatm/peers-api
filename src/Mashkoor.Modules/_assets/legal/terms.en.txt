<p> 
<strong>Loyalty Program.</strong> 
</p> 
<p>By becoming a User you are part of the Mashkoor Loyalty Program (the “Loyalty Program 
”) in those markets where the Loyalty Program is available. Users will accrue points 
through using the Mashkoor Platform to access Services provided by the third party 
service providers and may have access to a number of services, ways to support 
their local community, and benefits (“Rewards”) depending upon a given tier status 
(and relevant availability in any given market).</p> 
<p>Users can earn or maintain tier status based on their usage of the Mashkoor Platform 
in any calendar month. Once a User attains a tier level, it will remain in effect 
for 2 consecutive months. With respect to the expiry of points earned pursuant 
to the Loyalty Program, each calendar year consists of 2 reward periods: from January 
1st to June 30th and from July 1st to December 31st (each a “Reward Period”) and 
any points earned in one Reward Period will expire automatically at the end of 
the following Reward Period.</p> 
<p>Rewards are offered at the sole discretion of Mashkoor and may be varied from time 
to time. Rewards and participating partners may differ from market to market and 
may be added or removed at the sole discretion of Mashkoor. You may redeem points 
in exchange for Rewards or Donations (as applicable) at any time as indicated on 
the App. Where you redeem points Mashkoor shall settle the equivalent or agreed amount 
(if applicable) with the participating partner and cancel its liability to you 
for the same. By redeeming Rewards you confirm that you agree to the terms of the 
Loyalty Program.</p> 
<p>Mashkoor has the right to add, change, limit, modify or cancel Loyalty Program rules, 
regulations, rules for earning and redeeming Rewards points, rewards, reward levels, 
redemption levels, processes, benefits, tier statuses, and Loyalty Program partners 
without notice, even though such changes may affect the member’s tier status, the 
value of points already accumulated, the ability to use accumulated points, or 
the ability to obtain certain rewards.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Mashkoor may, among other things: (1) increase or decrease the number of points received 
for a given action or amount spent or the number of points required for a reward; 
(2) withdraw, limit, modify, or cancel any reward; (3) add blackout dates, limit 
availability for any reward, or otherwise restrict the continued availability of 
rewards; (4) change program benefits served by Rewards or its partners, conditions 
of participation, rules for earning, redeeming, retaining, or forfeiting points, 
or rules governing the use of rewards; (5) change or cancel rewards; and (6) change 
the rules governing the tier statuses, including but not limited to: rules to reach 
a tier status, duration and expiry rules of the tier status, benefits granted by 
reaching a given tier status.</p> 
<p>Mashkoor makes no warranties or representations, either expressed or implied, and 
expressly disclaim all liability (including consequential damages) with respect 
to type, timeliness, cost, quality or fitness of goods or services provided through 
the Loyalty Program.</p> 
<p>If any participating Rewards partner improperly denies a User an accrual or benefit, 
the liability of Mashkoor shall be limited to the equivalent value, in Rewards points, 
of that accrual or benefit as determined solely by Mashkoor.</p> 
<p>The Loyalty Program has no predetermined termination date and may continue until 
such time as Mashkoor decides to terminate the Loyalty Program, at any time, with 
or without notice. If the Loyalty Program is terminated, all unredeemed points 
or tier status benefits shall be forfeited without any obligation or liability, 
no award claims or tier status benefits shall be honoured after the conclusion 
of any notice period.</p> 
<p>Mashkoor reserves the right to cancel a User’s access to the Loyalty Program and 
revoke any and all unredeemed Mashkoor Rewards points collected by any Member who 
appears to be using the Loyalty Program in a manner inconsistent with the terms 
or intent of the Loyalty Program or any portion thereof. For reasons that include, 
but are not limited to: 1) violation of these terms and conditions; 2) misrepresentation 
of any information or any misuse of this Loyalty Program; 3) violation of any national, 
state or local law or regulation in connection with the use of this Loyalty Program; 
4) commission of fraud or abuse involving any portion of this Loyalty Program ; 
or 5) action, in any other way, to the detriment of the Loyalty Program or any 
of its stakeholders; all as may be determined by Mashkoor in its sole discretion.</p> 
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, Loyalty Program violations, fraud or abuse in relation 
to rewards points and credit, tier status or reward usage is subject to appropriate 
administrative and/or legal action by appropriate governmental authorities and/or 
by Mashkoor including, without limitation, the forfeiture of all point transfers, 
rewards, tier status or award issued pursuant to point redemptions and any accrued 
points in your account, as well as cancellation of the account.</p> 
<p>The earning and redeeming of Rewards points are subject to all applicable local 
laws and regulations and are offered in good faith, however they may not be available 
or are subject to change if prohibited or restricted by applicable law or regulation.</p> 
<p>Separate terms and conditions may apply to your reservation, purchase of goods 
and services, or rewards that you select. Please read these separate terms and 
conditions carefully. You agree to abide by the terms and conditions of purchase 
imposed by any supplier with whom you elect to deal. You understand that any violation 
of any such supplier's rules and restrictions may result in your being denied access 
to the applicable product or services, in your forfeiting any monies paid for such 
product or service.</p>

<strong>General Rules on Competitions, Contests and Giveaways</strong> 
</p> 
<p>Unless otherwise specified, Mashkoor will conduct all competitions, contests and 
giveaways (each a “Competition”) as described in this section and by entering or 
participating in a Competition, each entrant or participant (“Entrant”) agrees 
to these rules whether or not any separate additional specific terms apply to the 
Competition.</p> 
<p>When entering or participating in a Competition, an Entrant may be eligible for 
a prize specified in the corresponding promotional material (the “Prize”). Mashkoor 
may reject an entry at its own discretion, provided that such rejection will not 
conflict with applicable law.</p> 
<p>The Prize is non-transferable, non-exchangeable and no cash alternative is offered. 
In the event of a Prize being unavailable, Mashkoor reserves the right to offer an 
alternative prize of equal or greater value if circumstances beyond Mashkoor’s control 
makes it necessary to do so. To the extent permitted by law, the Competition Winner 
will be responsible for any and all taxes incurred in relation to receipt of the 
Prize.</p> 
<p>Participation in a Competition does not automatically mean that the Entrant has 
won the Prize. A winning entry (the “Competition Winner”) will be chosen by random 
draw (performed by a computer process or supervised by an independent third party) 
or by a panel of individuals adjudicating the entries. Reasonable efforts will 
made to contact the Competition Winner but if the Competition Winner cannot be 
contacted or fails to reply to Mashkoor’s communication within the communicated timeframe, 
Mashkoor reserves the right to offer the prize to the next eligible Entrant. Mashkoor 
will not be liable if the Prize does not reach the Competition Winner for reasons 
beyond Mashkoor’s reasonable control.</p> 
<p>Without prejudice to the “Disclaimers; Limitation of Liability; Indemnity” section, 
neither Mashkoor nor any Affiliates or Partners involved in a Competition will accept 
responsibility or liability for any errors, omissions, interruptions, deletion, 
or unauthorized access to Competition entries, or entries lost or delayed whether 
or not arising as a result of server functions, virus, bugs, or other causes outside 
Mashkoor’s, an Affiliate’s and/or a Partner’s control. IN NO EVENT SHALL MASHKOOR’S 
AND/OR AN AFFILIATE’S AND/OR A PARTNER’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO ANY ENTRANT FOR ALL 
DAMAGES, LOSSES AND CAUSES OF ACTION IN CONNECTION WITH ANY COMPETITION OR ANY 
MATERIAL PUBLISHED IN RELATION TO A COMPETITION EXCEED THE MONETARY VALUE OF THE 
PRIZE.</p> 
<p>Mashkoor reserves the right to cancel or amend the Competition and any associated 
terms and conditions. Any changes will be notified to the Entrants as soon as reasonably 
practical. If these terms do not, or do not clearly, cater for a solution to any 
matter which may arise, then Mashkoor shall have the sole discretion to decide finally 
on any such matter. Mashkoor’s decisions on any aspect of the Competition is final 
and binding and no correspondence will be entered into about it.</p>

<strong>Dispute Resolution</strong> 
</p> 
<p> 
<strong>Arbitration.</strong> 
</p> 
<p>You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to 
this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity 
thereof or the use of the Mashkoor Platform or Services (collectively, "Disputes") 
will be settled by binding arbitration between you and any relevant Affiliate in 
your jurisdiction, or between you and Mashkoor Networks FZ-LLC if no other Affiliate 
is incorporated in your jurisdiction, except that each party retains the right 
to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction 
to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation 
of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual 
property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and Mashkoor are each waiving 
the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class in any purported 
class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and the relevant 
Affiliate otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than 
one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or 
representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then 
the entirety of this "Dispute Resolution" section will be deemed void. Except as 
provided in the preceding sentence, this "Dispute Resolution" section will survive 
any termination of this Agreement. This “Dispute Resolution” section applies to 
all Disputes (as defined below) between you and Mashkoor and/or any of its Affiliates.</p> 
<p> 
<strong>Arbitration Process and Rules.</strong> 
</p>

with or relating to the Mashkoor Platform or this Agreement, including those relating 
to its validity, its construction or its enforceability (any “Dispute”) shall be 
first mandatorily submitted to mediation proceedings under the International Chamber 
of Commerce Mediation Rules (“ICC Mediation Rules”). If such Dispute has not been 
settled within sixty (60) days after a request for mediation has been submitted 
under such ICC Mediation Rules, such Dispute can be referred to and shall be exclusively 
and finally resolved by arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International 
Chamber of Commerce (“ICC Arbitration Rules”). The ICC Rules' Emergency Arbitrator 
provisions are excluded. The Dispute shall be resolved by one (1) arbitrator to 
be appointed in accordance with the ICC Rules. The place of both mediation and 
arbitration shall be in the city in which the applicable Affiliate with which you 
have a Dispute has its registered office. The language of the mediation and/or 
arbitration shall be English, unless you do not speak English, in which case the 
mediation and/or arbitration shall be conducted in both English and your native 
language. The existence and content of the mediation and arbitration proceedings, 
including documents and briefs submitted by the parties, correspondence from and 
to the International Chamber of Commerce, correspondence from the mediator, and 
correspondence, orders and awards issued by the sole arbitrator, shall remain strictly 
confidential and shall not be disclosed to any third party without the express 
written consent from the other party unless: (i) the disclosure to the third party 
is reasonably required in the context of conducting the mediation or arbitration 
proceedings; and (ii) the third party agrees unconditionally in writing to be bound 
by the confidentiality obligation stipulated herein.</p>

in whole or in part, under any law, such provision or part thereof shall to that 
extent be deemed not to form part of this Agreement but the legality, validity 
and enforceability of the other provisions in this Agreement shall not be affected. 
In that event, the parties shall replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable 
provision or part thereof with a provision or part thereof that is legal, valid 
and enforceable and that has, to the greatest extent possible, a similar effect 
as the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or part thereof, given the contents
